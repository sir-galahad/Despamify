# Despamify

# Installation
  1. Find your wow game folder. 
  2. Navigate to _classic_/Interface/AddOns/ you'll see all your other addons in that folder. 
  3. Create a new folder there called Despamify
  4. Copy Despamify.toc and Despamify.lua into that folder
  5. Exit your WoW client if it is running
  6. Restart WoW Despamify should already be working.
  7. there is only one option for Despamify which is weather despamify is on or off. 
     use /despam or /despamify to toggle whether it's on or off
  
# What to expect (Not much!)
  Despamify does one thing it blocks when messages to a chat frame are the same message as
the previous message. This should work to filter out the worst of the spam, but some will
still get through for example if someone is spamming a message and someone else (even 
someone else in a different channel on the same frame) says something in the spam their next
message will not be blocked. I have thoughts for how filtering might be better implemented, 
but that will probably only come to fruition if the author (me!) is annoyed enough by the 
spam that gets through to do something about it.
